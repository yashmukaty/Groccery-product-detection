# Groccery-product-detection
Build a ML model for product detection based on the mentioned parameters.
-> Size of product
(When a customer keeps a product in front of the camera, it should detect the product by determining the size of product. It should be able to distinguish between the products of same brand, but of different size. Refer the toothpaste example above.)
-> Train the ML Model.
-> Create a web application named ‘Kirana Product Billing’ for Product Detection and Billing. Integrate it with the trained ML model and show the details of the bill for products bought by the customer.
